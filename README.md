This is basically a boilerplate Rails 4 app with a bunch of code I used to (foolishly) write over and over again:

- A basic user model (see `user.rb`) with login and registration forms
- Useful gems like [strip_attributes](https://github.com/rmm5t/strip_attributes)
- A very simple layout using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and SASS
- Sensitive environment configuration pulled out into an `.env` file using [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)
- The beginnings of a test suite using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/)
